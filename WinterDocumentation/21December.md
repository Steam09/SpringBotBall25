# December 21st (Day 1)

## General Notes

## Logging into VSC
Set up VSC with the extensions of Microsoft C++, Microsoft SSH, and "Save as Sudo". Be sure to add the 2nd one to the computer, while the other two to the wombat itself. 

Logging into the wombat with "ssh kipr@192.168.125.1", password is "botball" or "e81fc300" for ours. Be sure to rebind the save as such to the ctrl + s. 

## Setting up the Github
This part doesn't really have that much information. 

## Main Parts
 - We need to write the code using VSC, but to make new files or run it the command needs to be straight from the online webserver.
