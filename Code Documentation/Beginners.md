This part assumes you're able to built the demobot and know the basics of movement with the wombat. You also should be able to run simple commands through the web IDE with the use of sensors (whether that be touch, camera, or IR). 

Now, you want the robot to do a bit more tahn just drive in a square right? Navigating the board is a hard task, and consistency is key in this type of competition. Things such as wall alignment, line tracking, and color detection were all major part of last year's board (and probably this years as well!).
